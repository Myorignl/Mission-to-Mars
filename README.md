# Mission-to-Mars
The objective of this project was to learn how to scrape items from a webpage and add them to a different page in a new format. 

I was able to get the immages requested 

- Deliverable 1 : Use the DevTools to inspect the page for the proper elements to scrape. You will need to retrieve the full-resolution image for each of Mars's hemispheres. Include image urls

- Deliverable  2 : Add the code you created in Deliverable 1 to your scraping.py file, update your Mongo database, and modify your index.html file so the webpage contains all the information you collected in this module as well as the full-resolution image and title for each hemisphere image.
